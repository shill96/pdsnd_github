### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Codes are written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also were tasked to write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### List of software required
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


### Files used
The following files are not uploaded to remote repo by using .gitignore because the files are too big:
    * chicago.csv
    * new_york_city.csv
    * washington.csv


### Credits
* [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
* [Numpy Manual](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/contents.html).    
* [Dataframe Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html#dataframe).
* [Stackoverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) is a great way to get solutions to all your errors.
